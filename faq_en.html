			</header>
			<button class="accordion">Who is this for?</button>
			<div class="panel p">
				<ul>
					<li>
						Anyone wanted to work in Switzerland as a consultant, freelancer or independant but who does really
						want to spend time on all the admin overhead. It is also very useful if you have less than the Swiss legal minimum
						of a least 3 customers to qualify as independant freelancer.
					</li>
					<li>
						People who retired but would like to keep working on some paid for projects.
					</li>
					<li>
						Small companies not managing enough loans to be able to negotiate good rates for
						insurances and social charges and/or do not have an HR function or accounting team taking
						care of salaries for a few employees.
					</li>
					<li>
						Companies wanting to keep employees during a crisis. This presents a good and more flexible
						alternative to layoffs.
					</li>
					<li>
						Companies needing specific resources for a specific mission. Our system allows hiring people
						without requiring companies to issue a fixed term contract, just let us manage all of that for you!
				</ul>

			<button class="accordion">How much will it cost me?</button>
			<div class="panel p">
				<p>BeeU will deduct a percentage fee from your salary. The exact amount will be determined
					depending on several factors but generally, if you do the math on the rate BeeU allows you to have
					access to (e.g., social insurances), you will realize that this amount is fairly small and reasonable.
				</p>
			</div>

			<button class="accordion">How much will I earn?</button>
			<div class="panel p">
				<p>As you might know the Swiss system is fairly complex and hence we
					cannot give you a one-size-fits-all answer. It will depend on many
					factors such as age, job, workload, etc. <a href="#footer">Contact us</a> and we'll
					be more than happy to give you an estimate for your profile.
				</p>
			</div>

			<button class="accordion">What benefits do I have working with BeeU?</button>
			<div class="panel p">
				<p><a href="decouvrir_en.html#avantages">Have a look at our explainer page to understand
						the advantages of working with BeeU.</a>
				</p>
			</div>

			<button class="accordion">Will BeeU find a job for me?</button>
			<div class="panel p">
				<p>Actually not, that's your mission! No one is better than you at finding your customer(s)!
					BeeU will take the admin burden off you. However, if we see an opportunity matching your profile
					we will of course contact you.
				</p>
			</div>

			<button class="accordion">I'm a company looking for a consultant for a specfic project, can you help me?</button>
			<div class="panel p">
				<p>Usually we work as an admin support between consultants and companies, however if you tell
					us more about the project you are looking to get consultants for we will be happy to see if
					any of our freelancers match your requirements.
				</p>
			</div>

			<button class="accordion">Am I covered if I have an accident while working or outside of work?</button>
			<div class="panel p">
				<p>Yes, as long as you work at least 8 hours per week
					we will insure you with our partner the Suva insurance.
				</p>
			</div>

			<button class="accordion">Am I covered if I'm ill?</button>
			<div class="panel p">
				<p>Yes, we will cover you via our health partner SWICA but only after you being sick for more than 30 days.
					This allows us to negotiate very good terms and we think it all makes sense as we know usually freelancers want
					to work as many days as they can!
				</p>
			</div>

			<button class="accordion">What about my pension</button>
			<div class="panel p">
				<p>That's one of the biggest advantages of working with BeeU: we look after your AHV (old age insurance)
					and your 2nd pillar pension.
				</p>
			</div>

			<button class="accordion">Will I get monthly and yearly payslips?</button>
			<div class="panel p">
				<p>Yes you'll receive both from us.</p>
